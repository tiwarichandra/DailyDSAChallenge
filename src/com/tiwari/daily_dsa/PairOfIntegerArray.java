/*
* Given an integer array, determine whether it can be divided into pairs such that the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by a given positive integer k.
For Example
Input:
arr[] = { 3, 1, 2, 6, 9, 4 }
k = 5

Output: Pairs can be formed

Explanation: Array can be divided into pairs {(3, 2), (1, 9), (4, 6)} where the sum of elements in each pair is divisible by 5.
